        JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, single-threaded, and interpreted compiled programming language. It was initially created to make web pages alive. The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.

        JavaScript is known for the development of web pages, and many non-browser environments also use it. It is a weakly typed language (dynamically typed)1. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments.

        On the client side, it supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). On the server side, it supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.

        JavaScript is both an imperative and declarative type of language. It contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements.

        It’s also important to note that JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles
