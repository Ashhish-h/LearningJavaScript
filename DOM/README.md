#DOM - Document Object Model
The DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. Here are some key points:

The DOM represents a web page as a tree-like structure of objects.
With the DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.
JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes and CSS styles in the page.
JavaScript can add and remove HTML elements and attributes.
JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page and create new ones.
The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.
The W3C DOM standard is divided into three different parts: Core DOM (standard model for all document types), XML DOM (standard model for XML documents), and HTML DOM (standard model for HTML documents).
In essence, the DOM provides a way for JavaScript to interact with HTML and XML documents, allowing for dynamic and interactive web experiences.
